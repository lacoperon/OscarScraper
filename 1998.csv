Thank you! This is a terrible mistake because I used up all my English. I don't know! I am not able to express all my gratitude, because now, my body is in tumult because it is a colossal moment of joy so everything is really in a way that I cannot express. I would like to be Jupiter! And kidnap everybody and lie down in the firmament making love to everybody, because I don't know how to express. It's a question of love. You are really -- this is a mountain of snow, so delicate, the suavity and the kindness, it is something I cannot forget, from the bottom of my heart.

I would like to thank the Academy from the bottom of my heart. I would like to thank Emily Watson, and Fernanda Montenegro, and my friend Cate Blanchett, and the greatest one who ever was, Meryl Streep. I don't feel very deserving of this in your presence.

But I would like to thank Harvey Weinstein and everybody at Miramax Films for their undying support of me. I would like to -- I wouldn't be in this auditorium, let alone up here, if it wasn't for two incredibly talented men. Our director John Madden, thank you so much for all that you gave me. You are so inspiring. And to my soulful partner, Joseph Fiennes, who I share this with. I wouldn't be here without him. I would like to thank the rest of our miraculous cast and crew. Our producers Donna Gigliotti and David Parfitt -- I didn't forget you this time! Especially Jim Magill and Sophie Shand and my friend Ben Affleck. I would like to thank my wonderful agent Rick Kurtzman who is a beautiful man and a wonderful agent and in his case that is not an oxymoron. I would like to thank Harold Brown, Stuart Gelwarg*, and Stephen Huvane.

I would not have been able to play this role had I not understood love of a tremendous magnitude, and for that I thank my family. My mother Blythe Danner, who I love more than anything, and my brother Jake Paltrow, who is just the dearest person in the whole world. My earthly guardian angel, Mary Wigmore*. And especially to my father Bruce Paltrow, who has surmounted insurmountable obstacles this year. I love you more than anything in the world. And to my grandpa Buster, who almost made it here tonight, but couldn't quite get here. Grandpa, I want you to know that you have created a beautiful family who loves you and loves each other more than anything, and we thank you for that.

I would like to dedicate this to two young men who lost their lives very early. Harrison Kravis and my cousin Keith Paltrow. We miss you very much. And I thank you. Thank you so much, everybody!

1998 (71st) Academy Awards,Actress in a Supporting Role,Shakespeare in Love,Judi Dench,Robin Williams,"JUDI DENCH:
I feel for eight minutes on the screen I should only get a little bit of him. I do thank the Academy very much indeed. I do think also that the best bit about the Academy Awards is being nominated. You live in a kind of haze for several weeks, and the terrible thing is that somebody's got to win. My heart goes out to all the other four who didn't. And also, my admiration.

I do have to thank John Madden and Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman, as I actually wrote to John Madden after ""Mrs. Brown"" and said, I will do anything in your next film. If you want somebody to slouch in a doorway, you can count on me. And I mean it, and I hope he bears me in mind next time. I do thank you all very much indeed. I am very moved by it. Thank you."

Thank you. Am I allowed to say I really wanted this? This is fantastic. Let me just turn my eyes to Mr. Hanks who from the very, very beginning said to me, this is going to be something extraordinary. We weren't really talking about the film, we were talking about the experience of making ""Saving Private Ryan,"" and he was right. It is one of the most extraordinary events of all of our lives, and the lives of all of our families, we were all in it together. Katie, for putting up with how much I've worried about this movie for the last eighteen months. Thank you for letting me be a neurotic at home. And all my children. I have two kids here tonight and they've never been to the Oscars before and I'm really happy I had a chance to make Max and Theo proud of their dad, and they're sitting up there somewhere. Thank you, kids, very, very much. And my other kids at home, Mikaela and Destry and Sasha and Sawyer, and Jessica who is here, too.

This has just been an amazing experience and what I'd like to do is just thank very, very sincerely the families who lost sons in World War II. I want to thank the Niland family and the Sullivan families, and I want to thank all the families who incurred these tremendous losses. In this war we tried to show a story of one such family, and it turned up there were many such families, unfortunately. And Dad, you're the greatest. Thank you for showing me that there is honor in looking back and respecting the past. I love you very much. This is for you. Thank you."

Wow, this is just fantastic. Thank you to the members of the Academy. We share this award with John Madden, because we wouldn't be up here without him.

My loving wife Eve; my two rotten kids, Lily and Emma; my beautiful nieces, Sarah and Nicole; and my mom Miriam. The Miriam of Miramax [music begins to play] who makes Jewish mothers look good.

1998 (71st) Academy Awards,Writing (Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen),Shakespeare in Love,"Marc Norman, Tom Stoppard","Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn","MARC NORMAN:

I'd like to thank on behalf of Tom, everybody at Miramax who worked so hard, especially Harvey Weinstein, a man of dedication and vision. A cast and crew that was exceptional.

All my parents, all my parents-in-law, who I will be with shortly when all this wonderful hoo-ha is over. Thank you.

My thanks to the Academy, to Marc, to Donna Gigliotti and David Parfitt who played good cop and very sweet cop to Commissioner Harvey. To John Madden, who is available.

1998 (71st) Academy Awards,Honorary Award,,"To Elia Kazan in recognition of his indelible contributions to the art of motion picture direction. (accompanied on stage by his wife, Frances Kazan)","Robert De Niro, Martin Scorsese","ELIA KAZAN:
I thank you very much. I really like to hear that. I want to thank the Academy for its courage, generosity. And I want to tell you that I've been a member of the Academy, on and off, for I don't know how many years, so I'm pleased to say what's best about them: They're damn good to work with. I also want to thank... Marty? Where are you? Where are you, hiding behind me? Where's Marty? Thank you [hugging Martin Scorsese]. And Bobby, Bobby De Niro [hugging Robert De Niro]. I want to thank you all very much. I think I can just slip away."
1998 (71st) Academy Awards,Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award,,Norman Jewison,Nicolas Cage,"NORMAN JEWISON:
Not bad for a goy. What do you say, Irving? They really keep this show going. Forty years of filmmaking and they did it in three minutes! Well, Irving, you're one heavy dude. I'll tell you that... You want to hold him? He's about twenty pounds!

There's a lot of people to thank, of course, but Irving once said that brevity is a great virtue. So, I accept this great honor tonight in the names of all those people who have contributed to my work, my life's work. Forty years ago, I sat at William Wyler's feet and tried to learn how to make movies. And Willy Wyler was a god to me, and he won this award. And I think that's what is so meaningful to me, to join all those filmmakers that have gone before. I would like to thank my immediate loved ones, my family, every actor, writer, editor, cinematographer, production designer, costume designer, sound man and editor I've ever worked with. All those crews in Europe and Canada and the United States.

And my one real regret about winning this prize is that, you know, it's not like the Nobel or the Pulitzer. I mean, the Thalberg Award comes with no money attached. If it did, if it did, I would share it with the Canadian Film Centre and the AFI where the next generation of filmmakers are preparing to entertain the world in the new millennium. And my parting thought to all those young filmmakers is this: Just find some good stories. Never mind the gross, the top ten, bottom ten, what's the rating, what's the demographic. You know something, the biggest grossing picture is not necessarily the best picture, I want to tell you something. So just tell stories that move us to laughter and tears, and perhaps reveal a little truth about ourselves. And as for myself, I hope to see you again next year!"
